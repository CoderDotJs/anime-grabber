The PROMPT.md file serves as a way for programmers and other potential users of
similar or vastly different backgrounds to configure an environment through
which they may tune their AI assistants to behave in such a way us to limit or
expand their solution space based on the information provided in the PROMPT.md
file.

Users may be able to use the PROMPT.md file by placing it in whatever Ai partner
of their choosing and thus define an environment for their partner to operate in
which may potentially lead to giving better solutions for certain problems and
improved collaboration.

This is very helpful for both solo and collaborative efforts such as teams. As the
non-deterministic nature of these tools currently means their can be many different
types of AI partners among users that may be able to arrive at different conclusions
which can be examined and implemented or further improved upon.
