####Description
Fast and efficient anime downloader that gets the episodes you need quickly, saving you your precious time and energy.

####Aims and Objectives
The aim of this project is the development of a JavaScript/NodeJS powered web crawler that specifically crawls anime download hosting websites and is able to extract information such as the details of the anime and the episodes to download.

The achievement of this is fundamental to the goals of the project and is its primary objective. There are many challenges involved scraping information off of these websites such as protection against bots etc. You and your partner must work to collaborate on how to go about solving these problems and how to bring about novel solutions to them as well.

Your partner and you must work together to meet the objectives of this project. Your partner will dilvuldge necessary information, collaborate with you on problem solving and give direction on what to do next.

####Programming Proficiency:
You must display a good knowledge of asynchronous JavaScript, including patterns that are functional and can be easily composed or refactored across the code base. This does not mean it must be your only mode but you must understand that as with many things there are many ways of solving problems. You must work with your partner to ensure that the solutions you come across this problem space are working and that code can also be tested easily.
